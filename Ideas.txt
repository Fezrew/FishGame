Rod Types:
Net - catches fish en masse once max proficiency

Bait Types:
Calming Bait - Automatic catch phase regardless of proficiency
Enraging Bait - Threshold fight catch phase regardless of proficiency

General:
Fishing Proficiency - The more you catch a certain fish, the easier it is to catch it again. Eventually gives an automatic catch phase.

-----Phases-----
General:
- Ideally all phase scripts are attached to a single item preset so it's easy to place it in a scene and change the settings.
(I don't know if this is possible with a static variable or if I should consider other methods)
- All the scripts attached to the preset are regular classes that hold the settings for the phase Scripts, which are attached to the player.

FishingManager:
- Has functions to be called by any phase script that proceeds fishing to next phase.

ApproachPhase:
- We don't think about approach phase, not yet.

BitePhase:
- Bitephase could be a scriptable object that instantiates a new object onto a player (Maybe when they start fishing, maybe at start time).
The reason for this is so the object has access to reference the player for playing sounds centred on them.
At the very least, BitePhase will be attaching something to each player for the sake of gaining reference.

CatchPhase:
- Test the phase by creating an AutoCatch phase first.
- Due to the existence of the player-specific progress bar, there will have to be an instance being created or attached to each player.
(Maybe scriptable object or inherited script)
